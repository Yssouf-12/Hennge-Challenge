"""
Variables:
An integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100): the number of test cases to process.

Each test case consists of two lines:
Line 1 of the case: an integer X (0 < X ​​≤ 100) indicating how many numbers should follow.

Line 2 of the case: a space-separated list of integers, expected to contain X integers (but sometimes it can be more or less).

i → the current index in the list of lines,

lines → the list of all input lines,

n → the number of cases remaining to process,

results → the accumulated list of results (sum or -1).
